# SEOF-current
Current version of the SEOF project in Matlab. There is a branch for MATLAB specific edits, and another for coversion products. 

For sufficient documentation: please create your own individual branch called your name under the Matlab specific edits and/or conversion products. Make another branch underneath that where you can work on things live, and then push to your branch when things work. We will meet and discuss what changes we should push to the main two branches.


How to use:
Open the SEOF_raytracing_main.m file. Make sure you change the filename to the local address of you \data folder. Change any of the variable values before line 64 if you want a different configuration, or different fidelity of the simulation. Hit the run button, wait..
